# Google+ iOS Demo using Swift and a Bridging Header
Demonstration of how to use a bridging header for Google+ Sign-In (iOS and Swift).

# Setup

Get a client ID from https://console.deveopers.google.com.
For the bundle ID, set it to com.gclassy.swiftsignin - if you want to change this
modify the bundle identifier in the project first. Also, you will need to update
the Scheme defined in the URL handlers in info.plist.
